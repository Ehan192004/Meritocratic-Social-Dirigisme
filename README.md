# Meritocratic-Social-Dirigisme

# Overview

Meritocratic Social Dirigisme (MSD) is a complete governance framework designed to address systemic failures in contemporary political systems through:

- Mathematical governance models** that make corruption detectable
- Meritocratic selection systems** that bypass patronage networks  
- Transparent algorithmic oversight** that prevents regulatory capture
- Planetary boundaries** as constitutional constraints
- Cultural continuity** as active preservation, not passive loss

# The Problem MSD Addresses

Current governance systems exhibit systematic architectural failures:

| System | Core Flaw | MSD Correction |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Liberal Democracy** | Short-termism, regulatory capture | Long-term chambers, algorithmic oversight |
| Authoritarian Systems** | Bureaucratic sclerosis, corruption | Dynamic meritocracy, rotation systems |
| Market Fundamentalism** | Externalization of costs, volatility | Strategic dirigisme, planetary boundaries |

# Core Architecture

# Five Constitutional Pillars:
1. Dynamic Meritocracy** - NSP assessment replaces political appointments
2. Strategic Social Dirigisme** - Conscious resource orchestration within ecological limits
3. The Social Covenant** - Legally-binding dignity guarantees
4. Cultural Continuity** - Active preservation against erosion
5. Educational Sovereignty** - Curriculum independence from ideological capture

# Key Innovations:
- Flourishing Index (FI)**: Multi-dimensional national performance metric
- Corruption Detection Index (CDI)**: Algorithmic detection of influence networks
- National Sovereignty Profile (NSP)**: Meritocratic selection system
- Metis Layer**: Institutional immune system for anomaly detection
- Icarus Fail-Safe**: Automatic system reboot on performance decline
